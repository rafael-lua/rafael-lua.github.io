        'My name is Rafael de Oliveira Tragueta, I am from Brazil.',
        'I have always been interested in coding. I gave my first steps in the field with game development around five years ago.',
        'My first genuine programming language was Lua with the Love game framework. From that, I kept jumping between engines and frameworks, trying new tools and languages.',
        'Eventually, I got into web development when trying to make games aiming for browsers. At the same time, I entered the FATEC university to study Systems Development and Analysis. As I discovered more of the web development world, I decided to follow this path professionally. I find the full stack flow very interesting and I pursue being capable of handling both front-end and back-end.',
